* 2D materials
- Proton conductivities have temperature dependence and exhibit Arrhenius-type behaviour $exp(-E / k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant cite:Hu2014.


** Graphene
- Electrical conductivity: either a shallow-gap semiconductor or a small-overlap semimetal cite:Novoselov2005.
- Proton conductivity: monolayer is lower than hBN. Bilayer is nonexistant cite:Hu2014.
- Stable up to 400 \deg{}C cite:Hu2014. 


*** Structure
- A hexagonal 2D atomic structure composed purely of carbon.
- AB stacking - layer 2 is offset from layer 1 cite:Hu2014. Bernal stacked configuration.
- Each carbon is sp2 hybridized. Each carbon bonds to three other carbons and a free electon is left in the p-orbital. This free electron leads to the various interesting properties of graphene, name its electical and thermal conductance.


*** Transport
- A perfect monolayer is impermeable to all but accelerated atoms cite:Hu2014.


*** Production
- Monolayer process: High Strength Metallurgical Graphene. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSMG][Wiki]].
- Bilayer process: 


*** Graphene Oxide (GO)
- Can be made such that water will permeate through a stack cite:Nair2012. While not immediately relevant, it's good to keep in mind some of the unexpected physics that could be exploited.

- See larger ion transport section.

**** Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO)
An attempt to obtain something close to graphene.


** Boron Nitride (hexagonal) (hBN)
- Electrical conductivity: insulating cite:Novoselov2005
- Proton conductivity: Best tested cite:Hu2014.

- "Monolayer hBN is more ¡®porous¡¯ than graphene, reflecting that the BN bond is strongly polarized, with valence electrons concentrated around N atoms." cite:Hu2014


*** Structure
- AA stacking - layer 2 directly on top of layer 1 cite:Hu2014.


** Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox
- Electrical conductivity: insulating cite:Novoselov2005


** Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)
- Electrical conductivity: heavily doped semiconductor >= 0.6 eV cite:Novoselov2005
- Proton conductivity: far less than even graphene cite:Hu2014.


** Niobium Selenide (NbSe2)
- Electrical conductivity: semimetal cite:Novoselov2005


* Transport

** Proton

- Graphene with platinum was shown to allow for hydrogen-exclusive flux accros the membrane cite:Hu2014.

- Naturally occuring defects in monolayer graphene can lead to proton transfer. If OH terminations: Grotthuss mechansim leads to proton transfer at room temperature. If ether terminations (pyrylium-like): no proton transfer, but still more energetically more favorable than no defect. cite:Achtyl2015a 
  - No vacancies: 3.9 eV
  - Ether capped: 2.5 eV
  - Hydroxyl cap: 0.7 eV
  - Aq. solution: <0.2 eV (activation energy of shuttling protons through aqueous solution)

** Protium Deuterium Separation

- Shown that H2, HD, and D2 can be separated using graphene cite:Lozada-Hidalgo2016.
  - $\sigma_H / \sigma_D \approx \exp(\Delta/k_BT)$
  - showed separation factor of ~10.
