abstract = {Using calculations from first principles and harmonic transition state theory, we investigated the permeability of a single graphene sheet to protons and hydrogen atoms. Our results show that while protons can readily pass through a graphene sheet with a low tunneling barrier, for hydrogen atoms the barriers are substantially higher. At the same time, the presence of defects in the membrane can significantly reduce the penetration barrier in a region that extends beyond the defect site itself.},

abstract = {One-atom-thick crystals are impermeable to atoms and molecules, but hydrogen ions (thermal protons) penetrate through them. We show that monolayers of graphene and boron nitride can be used to separate hydrogen ion isotopes. Using electrical measurements and mass spectrometry, we found that deuterons permeate through these crystals much slower than protons, resulting in a separation factor of ≈10 at room temperature. The isotope effect is attributed to a difference of ≈60 milli-electron volts between zero-point energies of incident protons and deuterons, which translates into the equivalent difference in the activation barriers posed by two-dimensional crystals. In addition to providing insight into the proton transport mechanism, the demonstrated approach offers a competitive and scalable way for hydrogen isotope enrichment.},

abstract = {Experiments are reported for hydrogen transport in palladium-coated membranes of niobium, tantalum, and vanadium. Two geometries are studied, coated discs 2 mm thick, and coated tubes of 0.25 mm wall thickness. The hydrogen is extracted at 100{\%} purity. Fluxes are much higher than with current palladium alloy and polymeric membranes at these pressures, and are somewhat higher than with palladium-coated porous ceramics. Palladium-coated niobium discs show effective permeabilities about 0.32 $\mu$mol/m-sec-Pa12 at 425°C and 2 atm pressure (including gas-phase resistance). The coated tubes have about 12 this permeability, and thus mass transport resistances about 1450 m2-sec-Pa12/mol. Coated tantalum discs have effective permeabilities about 0.1 $\mu$mol/m-sec-Pa12, but are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Since these coated-metals are stronger and more durable than palladium, ceramics of polymers, considerable design flexibility is possible. Based on these measurements, the flux for advanced membranes would be 2000 scf/hr-m2 for a driving force of 3 atm, suggesting attractive economics for petrochemical plant use.},

abstract = {Layered transition metal dichalcogenides are ideal systems for exploring the effects of dimensionality on correlated electronic phases such as charge density wave (CDW) order and superconductivity. In bulk NbSe2 a CDW sets in at TCDW = 33[thinsp]K and superconductivity sets in at Tc = 7.2[thinsp]K. Below Tc these electronic states coexist but their microscopic formation mechanisms remain controversial. Here we present an electronic characterization study of a single two-dimensional (2D) layer of NbSe2 by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and electrical transport measurements. We demonstrate that 3 [times] 3 CDW order in NbSe2 remains intact in two dimensions. Superconductivity also still remains in the 2D limit, but its onset temperature is depressed to 1.9[thinsp]K. Our STS measurements at 5[thinsp]K reveal a CDW gap of [Delta] = 4[thinsp]meV at the Fermi energy, which is accessible by means of STS owing to the removal of bands crossing the Fermi level for a single layer. Our observations are consistent with the simplified (compared to bulk) electronic structure of single-layer NbSe2, thus providing insight into CDW formation and superconductivity in this model strongly correlated system.},

The adsorption and desorption of H(2) and D(2) at 77 K on a carbon molecular sieve (Takeda 3A), where the kinetic selectivity was incorporated by carbon deposition, and a carbon, where the pore structure was modified by thermal annealing to give similar pore structure characteristics to the carbon molecular sieve substrate, were studied. The D(2) adsorption and desorption kinetics were significantly faster (up to x1.9) than the corresponding H(2) kinetics for specific pressure increments/decrements. This represents the first experimental observation of kinetic isotope quantum molecular sieving in porous materials due to the larger zero-point energy for the lighter H(2), resulting in slower adsorption/desorption kinetics compared with the heavier D(2). The results are discussed in terms of the adsorption mechanism.},

abstract = {Fast lateral proton migration along membranes is of vital importance for cellular energy homeostasis and various proton-coupled transport processes. It can only occur if attractive forces keep the proton at the interface. How to reconcile this high affinity to the membrane surface with high proton mobility is unclear. Here, we tested whether a minimalistic model interface between an apolar hydrophobic phase (n-decane) and an aqueous phase mimics the biological pathway for lateral proton migration. The observed diffusion span, on the order of tens of micrometers, and the high proton mobility were both similar to the values previously reported for lipid bilayers. Extensive ab initio simulations on the same water/n-decane interface reproduced the experimentally derived free energy barrier for the excess proton. The free energy profile G(H(+)) adopts the shape of a well at the interface, having a width of two water molecules and a depth of 6 ± 2RT. The hydroniums in direct contact with n-decane have a reduced mobility. However, the hydroniums in the second layer of water molecules are mobile. Their in silico diffusion coefficient matches that derived from our in vitro experiments, (5.7 ± 0.7) 10(-5) cm(2) s(-1). Conceivably, these are the protons that allow for fast diffusion along biological membranes.},

We attribute these seemingly incompatible observations to a low-friction flow of a monolayer of water through two-dimensional capillaries formed by closely spaced graphene sheets. Diffusion of other molecules is blocked by reversible narrowing of the capillaries in low humidity and/or by their clogging with water.},

Theoretical predictions have recently shown that energetic particles such as electrons and ions can induce polymorphic atomic defects in graphene layers as a result of knock-on atom displacements. However, the number of experimental reports on these defects is limited. The graphite network in single-walled carbon nanotubes has been visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and their chiral indices have been determined. But the methods used require a long image acquisition time and intensive numerical treatments after observations to find an 'average' image, which prevents the accurate detection and investigation of defect structures. Here we report observations in situ of defect formation in single graphene layers by high-resolution TEM. The observed structures are expected to be of use when engineering the properties of carbon nanostructures for specific device applications.},

We find high selectivity on the order of 10(8) for H(2)/CH(4) with a high H(2) permeance for a nitrogen-functionalized pore. We find extremely high selectivity on the order of 10(23) for H(2)/CH(4) for an all-hydrogen passivated pore whose small width (at 2.5 A) presents a formidable barrier (1.6 eV) for CH(4) but easily surmountable for H(2) (0.22 eV). These results suggest that these pores are far superior to traditional polymer and silica membranes, where bulk solubility and diffusivity dominate the transport of gas molecules through the material. Recent experimental investigations, using either electron beams or bottom-up synthesis to create pores in graphene, suggest that it may be possible to employ such techniques to engineer variable-sized, graphene nanopores to tune selectivity and molecular diffusivity. Hence, we propose using porous graphene sheets as one-atom-thin, highly efficient, and highly selective membranes for gas separation. Such a pore could have widespread impact on numerous energy and technological applications; including carbon sequestration, fuel cells, and gas sensors.},

abstract = {We report selective ionic transport through controlled, high-density, subnanometer diameter pores in macroscopic single-layer graphene membranes. Isolated, reactive defects were first introduced into the graphene lattice through ion bombardment and subsequently enlarged by oxidative etching into permeable pores with diameters of 0.40 ± 0.24 nm and densities exceeding 1012 cm–2, while retaining structural integrity of the graphene. Transport measurements across ion-irradiated graphene membranes subjected to in situ etching revealed that the created pores were cation-selective at short oxidation times, consistent with electrostatic repulsion from negatively charged functional groups terminating the pore edges. At longer oxidation times, the pores allowed transport of salt but prevented the transport of a larger organic molecule, indicative of steric size exclusion. The ability to tune the selectivity of graphene through controlled generation of subnanometer pores addresses a significant challenge in the dev...},

abstract = {The adsorption of molecular hydrogen on few-layer graphene (FLG) structures is studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The interaction between graphene and hydrogen molecules is described by the Lennard-Jones potential. The effects of pressure, temperature, number of layers in a FLG, and FLG interlayer spacing are evaluated in terms of molecular trajectories, binding energy, binding force, and gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC). The simulation results show that the effects of temperature and pressure can offset each other to improve HSC. An insufficient interlayer spacing (0.35 nm) largely limits the HSC of FLG because hydrogen adsorbed at the edges of the graphene prevents more hydrogen from entering the structure. A low temperature (77 K), a high pressure, a large number of layers in a FLG, and a large FLG interlayer spacing maximize the HSC.},

abstract = {In the last decade, ab initio simulations and especially Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics have significantly contributed to the improvement of our understanding of both the physical and chemical properties of water, ice, and hydrogen-bonded systems in general. At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

By careful control of the conditions for electrolysis, the separation factors could be determined with a probable error of ±4{\%}. From the temperature coefficients of the three separation factors $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, differences in activation energy of −1680, −2260, and −580 cal/mole have been calculated for electrolysis in the H–D, H–T, and D–T systems respectively. When conditions were less stringently controlled, the separation factor $\beta$ was found to be a linear function of the separation factor $\alpha$ according to an equation of the form $\beta$ = D$\alpha$−E. This relationship is of importance in the use of deuterium as a tracer in the electrolytic concentration of natural tritium. Some empirical equations showing the temperature influence on the variation of $\beta$ as a function of $\alpha$ are also included.},

abstract = {Many environmental technologies rely on containment by engineered barriers that inhibit the release or transport of toxicants. Graphene is a new, atomically thin, two-dimensional sheet material, whose aspect ratio, chemical resistance, flexibility, and impermeability make it a promising candidate for inclusion in a next generation of engineered barriers. Here we show that ultrathin graphene oxide (GO) films can serve as effective barriers for both liquid and vapor permeants. First, GO deposition on porous substrates is shown to block convective flow at much lower mass loadings than other carbon nanomaterials, and can achieve hydraulic conductivities of 5 × 10(-12) cm/s or lower. Second we show that ultrathin GO films of only 20-nm thickness coated on polyethylene films reduce their vapor permeability by 90{\%} using elemental mercury as a model vapor toxicant. The barrier performance of GO in this thin-film configuration is much better than the Nielsen model limit, which describes ideal behavior of flake-like fillers uniformly imbedded in a polymer. The Hg barrier performance of GO films is found to be sensitive to residual water in the films, which is consistent with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that show lateral diffusion of Hg atoms in graphene interlayer spaces that have been expanded by hydration.},

We also find, however, that boron permeation occurs by an intricate bond switching synergistic process with an activation energy of only 1.3eV, indicating easy B penetration upon moderate annealing. Nitrogen permeation has an intermediate activation energy of 3.2eV. The results show that by controlling annealing conditions, pristine graphene could allow the selective passage of atoms.},

@article{Mitsui2003,
abstract = {During reaction, a catalyst surface usually interacts with a constantly fluctuating mix of reactants, products, 'spectators' that do not participate in the reaction, and species that either promote or inhibit the activity of the catalyst. How molecules adsorb and dissociate under such dynamic conditions is often poorly understood. For example, the dissociative adsorption of the diatomic molecule H2--a central step in many industrially important catalytic processes--is generally assumed to require at least two adjacent and empty atomic adsorption sites (or vacancies). The creation of active sites for H2 dissociation will thus involve the formation of individual vacancies and their subsequent diffusion and aggregation, with the coupling between these events determining the activity of the catalyst surface. But even though active sites are the central component of most reaction models, the processes controlling their formation, and hence the activity of a catalyst surface, have never been captured experimentally. Here we report scanning tunnelling microscopy observations of the transient formation of active sites for the dissociative adsorption of H2 molecules on a palladium (111) surface. We find, contrary to conventional thinking, that two-vacancy sites seem inactive, and that aggregates of three or more hydrogen vacancies are required for efficient H2 dissociation.},

The parameters were derived from quantum chemical calculations on bond dissociation and reactions of small molecules plus heat of formation and geometry data for a number of stable hydrocarbon compounds. We find that the ReaxFF provides a good description of these data. Generally, the results are of an accuracy similar or better than PM3, while ReaxFF is about 100 times faster.

However, a perfect graphene monolayer is impermeable to all atoms and molecules under ambient conditions: even hydrogen, the smallest of atoms, is expected to take billions of years to penetrate graphene's dense electronic cloud. Only accelerated atoms possess the kinetic energy required to do this. The same behaviour might reasonably be expected in the case of other atomically thin crystals. Here we report transport and mass spectroscopy measurements which establish that monolayers of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are highly permeable to thermal protons under ambient conditions, whereas no proton transport is detected for thicker crystals such as monolayer molybdenum disulphide, bilayer graphene or multilayer hBN. Protons present an intermediate case between electrons (which can tunnel easily through atomically thin barriers) and atoms, yet our measured transport rates are unexpectedly high and raise fundamental questions about the details of the transport process. We see the highest room-temperature proton conductivity with monolayer hBN, for which we measure a resistivity to proton flow of about 10 $\Omega$ cm(2) and a low activation energy of about 0.3 electronvolts. At higher temperatures, hBN is outperformed by graphene, the resistivity of which is estimated to fall below 10(-3) $\Omega$ cm(2) above 250 degrees Celsius. Proton transport can be further enhanced by decorating the graphene and hBN membranes with catalytic metal nanoparticles. The high, selective proton conductivity and stability make one-atom-thick crystals promising candidates for use in many hydrogen-based technologies.},

abstract = {Graphene oxide (GO) contains several chemical functional groups that are attached to the graphite basal plane and can be manipulated to tailor GO for specific applications. It is now revealed that the reaction of GO with ozone results in a high level of oxidation, which leads to significantly improved ionic (protonic) conductivity of the GO. Freestanding ozonated GO films were synthesized and used as efficient polymer electrolyte fuel cell membranes. The increase in protonic conductivity of the ozonated GO originates from enhanced proton hopping, which is due to the higher content of oxygenated functional groups in the basal planes and edges of ozonated GO as well as the morphology changes in GO that are caused by ozonation. The results of this study demonstrate that the modification of dispersed GO presents a powerful opportunity for optimizing a nanoscale material for proton-exchange membranes.},

abstract = {The elementary steps of proton conductivity in oxides, proton transfer and hydroxyl ion reorientation, are investigated and the anticipated HD isotope effects of their rates are compared to those of proton (deuteron) conductivity. It is concluded that the rate of proton diffusivity in many oxides is limited by proton transfer between fixed oxygen sites. This is facilitated by the thermal fluctuation of the oxygen ion separation. In the case of a rigid array of oxygen ions an attempt frequency close to that of the OH (OD) oscillator and a high activation enthalpy is expected. The effect of softening the OO vibration is to decrease the attempt frequency and activation barrier. Criteria for high diffusivities of protonic defects in oxides are formulated.},

We investigate permeation through micrometer-thick laminates prepared by means of vacuum filtration of graphene oxide suspensions. The laminates are vacuum-tight in the dry state but, if immersed in water, act as molecular sieves, blocking all solutes with hydrated radii larger than 4.5 angstroms. Smaller ions permeate through the membranes at rates thousands of times faster than what is expected for simple diffusion. We believe that this behavior is caused by a network of nanocapillaries that open up in the hydrated state and accept only species that fit in. The anomalously fast permeation is attributed to a capillary-like high pressure acting on ions inside graphene capillaries.},

Here we subject single-layer graphene supported on fused silica to cycles of high and low pH, and show that protons transfer reversibly from the aqueous phase through the graphene to the other side where they undergo acid-base chemistry with the silica hydroxyl groups. After ruling out diffusion through macroscopic pinholes, the protons are found to transfer through rare, naturally occurring atomic defects. Computer simulations reveal low energy barriers of 0.61-0.75 eV for aqueous proton transfer across hydroxyl-terminated atomic defects that participate in a Grotthuss-type relay, while pyrylium-like ether terminations shut down proton exchange. Unfavourable energy barriers to helium and hydrogen transfer indicate the process is selective for aqueous protons.},

The effect is more pronounced for the hydroxide than for the hydronium.

abstract = {Membranes act as selective barriers and play an important role in processes such as cellular compartmentalization and industrial-scale chemical and gas purification. The ideal membrane should be as thin as possible to maximize flux, mechanically robust to prevent fracture, and have well-defined pore sizes to increase selectivity. Graphene is an excellent starting point for developing size-selective membranes because of its atomic thickness, high mechanical strength, relative inertness and impermeability to all standard gases. However, pores that can exclude larger molecules but allow smaller molecules to pass through would have to be introduced into the material. Here, we show that ultraviolet-induced oxidative etching can create pores in micrometre-sized graphene membranes, and the resulting membranes can be used as molecular sieves. A pressurized blister test and mechanical resonance are used to measure the transport of a range of gases (H(2), CO(2), Ar, N(2), CH(4) and SF(6)) through the pores. The experimentally measured leak rate, separation factors and Raman spectrum agree well with models based on effusion through a small number of {\aa}ngstrom-sized pores.},

abstract = {The pH-indicator dye fluorescein was covalently bound to the surface of the purple membrane at position 72 on the extracellular side of bacteriorhopsin and at positions 101, 105, 160, or 231 on the cytoplasmic side by reacting bromomethylfluorescein with the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. At position 72, on the extracellular surface, the light-induced proton release was detected 71 +/- 4 microseconds after the flash (conditions: pH 7.3, 22 degrees C, and 150 mM KCl). On the cytoplasmic side with the dye at positions 101, 105, and 160, the corresponding values were 77, 76, and 74 +/- 5 microseconds, respectively. Under the same conditions, the proton release time in the bulk medium as detected by pyranine was around 880 microseconds--i.e., slower by a factor of more than 10. The fact that the proton that is released on the extracellular side is detected much faster on the cytoplasmic surface than in the aqueous bulk phase demonstrates that it is retained on the surface and migrates along the purple membrane to the other side. These findings have interesting implications for bioenergetics and support models of local proton coupling. From the small difference between the proton detection times by labels on opposite sides of the membrane, we estimate that at 22 degrees C the proton surface diffusion constant is greater than 3 x 10(-5) cm2/s. At 5 degrees C, the proton release detection time at position 72 equals the faster of the two main rise times of the M intermediate (deprotonation of the Schiff base). At higher temperatures this correlation is gradually lost, but the curved Arrhenius plot for the proton release time is tangential to the linear Arrhenius plot for the rise of M at low temperatures. These observations are compatible with kinetic coupling between Schiff base deprotonation and proton release.},

As the thinnest material, graphene is composed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms linked to one another in a 2D honeycomb lattice with high electron-density in its aromatic rings, which blocks-off all molecules. This phenomena, in combination with its strong structure (C–C bond energy=4.9eV and intrinsic strength=43N/m) makes graphene the most impermeable membrane (thinnest membrane that is impermeable). Apart from the applications mentioned above, graphene coatings have enabled fundamental studies on chemical processes and fluid structures. For example, graphene can allow electron imaging of nanocrystal nucleation process and water-lattice-structure due to its impermeability. Along with being the strongest, most conductive, and optically-absorbing material (∼2.3{\%} optical absorbance), graphene’s impermeability opens a wide range of exciting opportunities.},
